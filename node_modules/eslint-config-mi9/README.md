# Mi9 JS/ES6 Coding Standard

This package provides Mi9's .eslintrc as an extensible shared config, based on [Airbnb's *mostly reasonable approach to JavaScript*][1]. It extends upon Airbnb's published ESLint package to provide defaults more appropriate for Mi9's style. Read Airbnb's [Style Guide document][1] - it's very good and explains rational behind a lot of the rules enforced by this config.

**Important:** This package has a dependency on `eslint-config-airbnb`, as it extends that config. It is important this dependency remains pinned to an exact version as Airbnb bump the patch version when making changes, which can lead to our projects unexpectedly using a newer set of rules.

## Using

Once installed via NPM, create a `.eslint` file in the root of your project simply containing:

```javascript
{
  "extends": "eslint-config-mi9",
}
```

If you're using flow make sure to install the peer dependency `eslint-plugin-flowtype` and then add to `extends` as below.

### With Flow

```
{
  "extends": "eslint-config-mi9/flow"
}
```

## IDE/Editor Intergration

While a linting step in your build pipeline will almost always exist, it is **strongly** recommended that you set up your text editor to have ESLint intergration so you get feedback as you type.

Your collegues are using:

 * **Sublime Text 3**: [SublimeLinter-eslint][2]
 * **Atom**: [linter-eslint][3]

Sometimes they can be a bit tricky to set up, so if you have any issues talk to a collegue who has already been there.

## Deviations from Airbnb

This config extends upon Airbnb's ESLint config and overrides some properties.

### General

 * React is brought in by default.
 * **`globals`:** Extra variables (`__DEVELOPMENT__`, `__CLIENT__`, `__SERVER__`, `__DEVTOOLS__`) that are commonly used global constances are allowed. Usually defined and/or replaced with build tools (such as webpack).

### Rules

 * **`func-names`:** Don't warn about anonymous functions. Although named functions are preferred, anonymous funcs are used frequently enough that warnings would be of very little value and only clutter linting output.

 * **`no-multi-spaces`:** Enforce no extra spaces. This is mainly to prevent variable or import alignment (which makes diffs harder to read)

 * **`padded-block`:** We don't require a new line at the beginning and end of functions. Shorter and easier to read functions are prefered.

 * **`no-unused-expressions`**: Allow using `foo && bar()` to conditionally run a function.

 * **`no-warning-comments`**: Warn about TODO and FIXME comments
